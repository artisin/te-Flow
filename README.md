#teFlow _function-control-and-flow_
A function wrapper to help you orginize your code in cleaner functional manner. I typically use a promise library to structor my code base like (ASQ)[https://github.com/getify/asynquence] but when I'm unable to do so I wanted to still maintain a clean functional manner. In a nut-shell teFlow creates an argument stream which it passes to said wrapped functions through `apply`.
